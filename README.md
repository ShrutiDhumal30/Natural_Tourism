## Project Overview:
The goal of this website is responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, socially and economically sustains the well-being of the local people,
and creates knowledge and understanding through interpretation and education.To establish an immersive and informative static website on nature tourism, leveraging Azure services for robust hosting,
scalability, and efficient containerization.One another goal is to showcase captivating nature destinations, promote eco-friendly tourism, and provide visitors with a seamless browsing experience, 
thereby fostering an increased appreciation for and engagement with natural environments.


## Project Description:
The project aims to develop and deploy a static website dedicated to promoting nature tourism experiences across diverse destinations. Leveraging Azure services including Virtual Machine (VM), 
Container Instances (ACI), and Container Registry, the website will serve as an engaging platform showcasing the beauty, adventure, and conservation efforts related to nature-based travel.
. This website shows us tourism based on the natural attractions of an area. Also, we used this website for formal idea of the nature tourism. Also gave us the formal information about their tours and guides.
In this website there is also one contact page where any tourism can submit their feedback about their experience. 


## Key Objectives:
**1)Content Creation:** Curate compelling content, high-resolution imagery, and multimedia elements to feature various nature tourism spots, activities, and conservation initiatives.

**2)Design and Development:** Craft an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure seamless navigation and an immersive user experience.

**3)Azure Service Integration:**

**Virtual Machine (VM):** Provision and configure a VM on Azure to host the static website files securely and reliably.

**Container Registry:** Establish an Azure Container Registry to store Docker images and manage the containerization of the website.

**Container Instances (ACI):** Utilize Azure Container Instances for scalable and efficient deployment of the website using containerized applications.


## Expected Outcomes:

-> A visually captivating and user-friendly static website offering visitors an immersive experience into various nature tourism destinations.

-> Seamless deployment and hosting of the website using Azure services, ensuring scalability, security, and reliability.

-> Increased awareness and engagement in eco-friendly tourism, promoting the preservation of natural environments and supporting local conservation efforts.

-> A documented guide for future updates, maintenance, and management of the website and associated Azure services.


## Project Screenshots:
1)First we create one **Resource Group**

2) Now we create one **Virtual Network** in that Resource Group. A Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure can be beneficial for broader infrastructure and security purposes,
especially if you plan to expand the project or implement additional services that require network isolation or specific connectivity.

3) After that we create one **Virtual Machine** in that Resource group using that Vnet. We use that virtual machine for hosting our website.

4) Now we create one **Container Registry** .Azure Container Registry (ACR) can be utilized for managing and storing Docker container images.
 Although a static website typically does not require containers for hosting, ACR can still play a role in containerizing specific components or services, or in future expansion of the project.

5) Create one **Container Instances**.Container Instances (ACI) might not directly host the static website itself as it's typically used for running containers.
 However, ACI can be employed in auxiliary roles or future functionalities within the project.While a static website might not directly leverage ACI for hosting, its flexibility and ability to
 rapidly deploy containers make it a useful tool for running auxiliary services, facilitating testing environments, or managing specific backend functionalities in a project related to natural tourism

6)Now create on **Azure Machine Learning** that will run in the backend.In a project focused on a static website for nature tourism, machine learning (ML) can be integrated to enhance user experience,
provide personalized recommendations, or analyze data for insights.

7) Now copy the link in the Container Instances and paste it in browser and you can aable to see your static website.Follow are some outputs of the website.
